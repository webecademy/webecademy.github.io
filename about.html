  <span style="font-size:35px;">Hi! I am  <b>Sandeep</b></span><br/>
  I founded <b>Webecdemy.club</b> as an endeavour towards digital marketing education particularly focussing on web design & development. I've been a professional web designer/developer & digital marketer for the last 10 years and have worked on building multiple websites ranging from small businesses to Fortune 500 corporations across the world.<br/>
  I beleive web design is something that can help lot of businesses in getting their word out by simply building a website by uilizing free & open source tools hat too without any programming knowledge. Due to the internet being so easily accessible to people,  visibility on the web has become quite essential for any business.<br/>
  As of now, the courses created by me are listed on <i><a class="link" href="#"> &nbsp;Skillshare&nbsp; </a></i>
